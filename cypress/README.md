Test Execution:
1.Running the Cypress Tests for E-commerce (Demoblaze)
To execute the e-commerce scenario tests:

    Open Command Prompt and navigate to the project directory.
        Run the following command to open the Cypress Test Runner:
                npx cypress open

In the Cypress Test Runner, select the test file for Demoblaze (e.g., addProductsAndPlaceOrder.cy.js), which is located in the cypress/e2e/UITest directory and select the test file for Demoblaze (e.g., createGetDeleteUser.cy.js), which is located in the cypress/e2e/APITest directory. Cypress will launch a browser and execute the test steps.

Alternatively, to run the test in headless mode:

To Run APITest
npx cypress run --spec "cypress/e2e/APITest/createGetDeleteUser.cy.js"

To Run UITest
npx cypress run --spec "cypress/e2e/UITest/addProductsAndPlaceOrder.cy.js"
